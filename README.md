_**1. K Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**_: The k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is a non-parametric, supervised learning method first developed by Evelyn Fix and Joseph Hodges in 195112. It is used for both classification and regression.

_**2. K Means Clustering**_: The k-Means Clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm used to solve clustering problems in machine learning or data science1. It groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters.

_**3. Gradient Descent**_: Gradient Descent is a first-order iterative optimization algorithm for finding a local minimum of a differentiable multivariate function1. Itâ€™s an essential tool in machine learning and deep learning for minimizing the cost or loss function.

_**4. Linear Regression**_: Linear Regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
